# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: October 5, 2024**

## 1. Introduction

Thank you for using **Live Translation** ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our iOS live translation app. Your privacy is important to us.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Personal Information We Collect

The App itself does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

The App provides offline text translation, photo text recognition, and real-time video translation, all processed locally on your device.

However, we use Google ML Kit to perform some of these functions. Google ML Kit may collect certain data according to their own privacy practices. Please review [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to understand what data may be collected and how it is handled by Google.

## 4. Use of Google ML Kit

The App integrates Google ML Kit for language translation and text recognition. While we do not collect data, Google may collect certain usage data through their services. Please refer to [Google's ML Kit Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms) for more information on their data handling practices.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or distribute your data to any third parties. As all translation processes occur locally, no personal data is sent to external servers from the App.

## 6. Data Retention

The App does not retain or store any data. All information used for translation and text recognition is processed in real-time and is not saved once the process is complete.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be updated. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
